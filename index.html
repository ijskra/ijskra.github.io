            <h2 data-heading="About Me">About Me</h2>
            <p>OH Jung-Woong (also known as Jake) is a composer, performer, and producer who recently obtained his doctorate degree from Indiana University in Bloomington. During his time at IU, he studied music composition with P.Q. Phan and Eugene O'Brien, harpsichord with Elisabeth Wright and Jonathan Oddie, and computer music with John Gibson and Chi Wang. His musical education was further enriched by masterclasses with renowned composers such as Unsuk Chin, Georg Friedrich Haas, and Sven-David Sandström.
After completing his military service, OH returned to his studies, culminating in the completion of his doctoral degree in 2024. His academic journey has been marked by a diverse range of musical interests and a commitment to pushing the boundaries of contemporary classical music.
Since 2014, OH has focused significantly on microtonal music, influenced by composers like Georg Friedrich Haas and Easley Blackwood. This research resulted in works such as "Romanze," "Torso of The Sapphire Wings," and "Microtonal Bagatelles." He has shown particular interest in 24EDO and 36EDO tuning systems, exploring the expanded possibilities of emotional expression through these alternative tunings.
OH's musical interests are diverse, encompassing styles from Renaissance madrigals to microtonal guitar quintets with live electronics, from jazz standard piano trios to metal bands, and from dark techno to chiptune-styled K-Pop. This versatility is reflected in his compositions, which have been performed and broadcast numerous times throughout Asia, North America, and Europe.
Since 2017, OH has also developed a keen interest in early music, studying harpsichord and incorporating elements of historical performance practice into his compositional approach. This interest in historical forms coexists with his exploration of cutting-edge electronic and computer music techniques.
At the core of OH's musical philosophy is a focus on human emotion, which he considers an entity not fully expressible through language alone. His musical explorations and experiments aim to expand the "logical space" of human emotion, using any means at his disposal. As a performer, OH is known for his remarkable knowledge and swift intuition in improvisation across various genres and in basso continuo playing.
OH's works have garnered recognition in various competitions and festivals. Notable achievements include winning awards at the 27th "Night of Young Composers" by Daejeon Contemporary Music Association in 2015 and the Composition Competition of the Contemporary Music Society in Seoul in the same year.
With his doctoral degree now completed, OH Jung-Woong continues to push the boundaries of contemporary classical music, blending historical knowledge with modern techniques to create unique and emotionally resonant compositions.</p>
